BUGS:
changing 1 setting that isn't color file, removes color file
show valuable bodies in case system was discovered before
on no star discovery after jump, pull bodies from EDSM and appraise???
investigate border around current system, perhaps hyperspace indicator fucking up?
make title dynamic
make name col wider to accomodate belts
bodies don't seem to be sorting while scanning
systems sometimes show as NaN
make star name not empty if it's the only star
add minimize button
